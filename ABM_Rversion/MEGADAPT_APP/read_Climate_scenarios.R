#read scenarios of rainfall and run-offs.
#read a data frame with:
  #ID of agebs
  #Estimations of runoff for N years of simulation per ageb
  #Estimations of volume of rainfall for N years of simulation per ageb

#Every year of simulation, sample with a uniform distribution a single year of estimations from the N columns posible (2001-20013?)
